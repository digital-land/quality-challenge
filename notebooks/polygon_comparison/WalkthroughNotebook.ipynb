    "data[\"geometry\"][10] is a good counterexample, on LHS issue of needing to clock going OUT but current method does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "data[\"geometry\"][257] (Heyroyd) is weird and shows issues with OSM. There is something that SHOULD be a residential area at the top, but the line goes straight through. Just grey \"nothing\" - no tags. This is the base layer so has small borders around everything, meaning it will be hard to select 'all that does not have a tag' as a polygon in and of itself. Maybe SAM could work, but this is getting difficult now."

    "Example below has a clear issue on OSM - the left hand side at the top corner clearly goes through houses when looking at the satellite images, but the area is generic with no tags. Although there is a residential area below which we would ideally want to snap to, because there is not a polygon on <i>both sides</i>, the model struggles to highlight the area as there is no overlap with an area of interest. This is also looks very wrong - setting the distance to e.g. 200 snaps to some of the top of the residential area, but again as the field is not a polygon, it is not highlighted as added area.\n",

It is odd that brdr has chosen to align on the inside in this case, but it still highlights that something is wrong - when brdr is confused, even if it doesn't get it right, it is still useful to indicate things are not cut and dry! Setting the distance lower, say to 20, results in worse detection due to the scale of how wrong this conservation area is."
