## Overview
This project uses `crawl4ai` for deep web crawling and `Jupyter Notebook` for interactive experiments. The setup script automates installation and launches the notebook.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11.9** (Recommended, but other 3.11 versions may work)
- Your favourite **virtual environment** 

## Setup Instructions
Run the setup script:

```sh
bash run_notebook.sh
```

This will install the requirements, set up crawl4ai and run the notebook.
