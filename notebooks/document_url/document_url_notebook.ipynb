    "## Our approach\n",

    "Our approach involves 2 main steps: a web crawler and an embedding similarity search. Below is a description of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web crawler\n",
    "\n",
    "The web crawler takes a homepage URL of an organisation (council website) and crawls it to look for pages talking about conservation areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crawler will look for links on a single page, put them in a queue and then iteratively check them until it finds what it was looking for or it reaches a stopping criterion, such as maximum depth (how many clicks away from home page). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to save time, we can define some scorers or filters which tell the crawler which pages to prioritise or ignore. In this case, some common patterns of what a user needs to click to get to the page of interest are _\"planning\"_, _\"building\"_, _\"heritage\"_ or _\"conservation\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crawler uses a *\"best first strategy\"*, which utilises the scorers or filters to visit most relevant sites first, rather than a depth-first or breath-first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crawler extracts the HTML from the pages and turns them into markdown. This is because it's more readable and easier to work with in the next steps. The crawler returns a list of pairs of (_url_, _markdown_).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding search\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### The next few cells show how to use the tools to find conservation area pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define your own parameters, such as maximum depth, how many results you want to see and any scorers or filters. Below is a template showing how to defin each scorer/filter type correctly - all you need to do is change the keywords or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define a prompt - this is what will be used to get embeddings scores for a webpage. The more similar the prompt is to what a conservation area page usually looks like, the more accurate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you can await the `process_council` function, which will run the functionality described above and print the results. You can use it for one council only or for a list of councils."
