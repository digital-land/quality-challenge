    "### 1. Satellite images\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the challenge is getting satellite images of the area of interest. This notebook shows how to download high resolution satellite images using 3 different sources: a WMS service, Google map tiles service and Google static maps service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tree detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the satellite image is downloaded we use a model to identify all trees in the image. The model will create a box around every tree and return pixel values bounding the box. This notebook shows what that looks like for different images.\n",

    "### 3. Flagging issues\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the distances between every tree box and the original point, and sort them. If the point marks a real tree, the closest box should be within a pre-defined distance of the point. This distance is configurable but 10 metres seems to be a good balance between allowing some noise due to factors like shadows, dense trees etc. If the closest box is further, we flag the data point for review."
