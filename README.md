# AI and machine learning challenges for improving planning data quality

This repository contains scenarios, test cases and code for challenges to scale how we improve the quality of data on https://planning.data.gov.uk

Testing and assuring our data quality is intended to complement our with work with [i.AI](https://ai.gov.uk/) to increase the availability of data by [extracting data from documents](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues/360).
